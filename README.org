A simple setup to test org-noter in a sandbox.


* How to test org-noter in a sandbox

In general, I dont want to break my day-to-day emacs instance. I also want to ensure that the changes I make work apart from my "standard" config.

To do this, I spin up a "clean room" version of vanilla emacs and then install minimum number of packages to run org-noter.


1. Install [[https://github.com/alphapapa/with-emacs.sh][with-emacs.sh]]
2. Clone https://github.com/org-noter/org-noter-with-emacs-basic-test

   #+begin_src bash
     git clone git@github.com:org-noter/org-noter-with-emacs-basic-test.git
   #+end_src

3. Execute =with-emacs.sh= from your =org-noter-with-emacs-basic-test= directory:

   #+begin_src bash :results none
     foo=`find ~/ -name with-emacs.sh -type f -perm -u+x`
     $foo -P -R -d . -- +22:38 install-straight.el
     unset foo
   #+end_src

4. Evaluate the buffer with =M-x eval-buffer=.

As a result of this, you'll end up with a completely stand-alone instance of Emacs with all necessary packages installed to run a clean version of org-noter.

You can now run your org-noter tests.

Remove the =straight= directory and rerun.
